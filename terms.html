        <ul>
            <li>Your rankings regarding dishes and restaurants are based on your actual, first-hand experiences.</li>

        <h2>5. Special Features & Disclaimers</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Industry Verification</h3>
        <p>"Verified" status is provided as a community indicator and indicates a user's likely connection to or experience in the hospitality industry. It is NOT a criminal background check, employment verification, safety clearance, endorsement, or guarantee of current employment status or professional competence. Present Advisory LLC expressly disclaims any and all liability for the actions, conduct, advice, or recommendations of any Verified user.</p>

        <h3>5.2 User Experiences & "The Handshake"</h3>
        <p>Descriptions of tipping strategies, "greasing the palm," or service interactions reflect individual user experiences and opinions. Pursuant to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, WildHeavy is a neutral platform and is not the publisher or speaker of this information. WildHeavy does not officially encourage, endorse, condone, or induce bribery, trespassing, violation of health codes, or any illegal activity. You are solely responsible for your conduct in physical establishments.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Features</h3>
        <p>WildHeavy utilizes AI and LLMs for strategy recommendations and data normalization. AI is experimental. You acknowledge that AI outputs may be inaccurate, incomplete, or "hallucinate" facts. Do not rely on AI features for medical, legal, financial, or nutritional advice.</p>

        <h3>5.4 Reservation & Availability Data</h3>
        <p>We are an information tool, not a reservation agent. We are not responsible for failed bookings, lost deposits, or disputes with third-party booking platforms or restaurants.</p>

        <h3>5.5 Content Moderation & Data Integrity</h3>
        <p>The "Janitor" System: We use AI-assisted tools to normalize dish names (e.g., standardizing "burger" vs "Burger"). This automated processing is a technical necessity to maintain clean, searchable data and does not constitute an editorial modification of your original text, which remains preserved. All moderation actions are logged in our internal audit system.</p>
